# ES6 Pure Webpack Boilerplate with Jest and ESLint
Built upon https://github.com/metagrover/ES6-boilerplate and adapted to meet my own needs, a pure JS webpack boilerplate
with jest and eslint support.

## Usage
* `npm run build-dev` to run tests, linting and then build a minified version in build/dist, in that order.
* `npm run build-prod` the same as npm run build-dev but without source maps bundled.
